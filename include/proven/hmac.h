/**
 * @file hmac.h
 * @brief HMAC (RFC 2104) and HKDF (RFC 5869) over SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.
 *
 * Two different jobs that are built from the same piece:
 *
 *   - **HMAC answers "did someone who knows the key produce this message?"** A digest alone
 *     cannot: anyone can hash anything. HMAC mixes a secret key into the digest so that only a
 *     holder of the key can compute it - a message authentication code. Use it to sign a
 *     cookie, a webhook, a token, a message between two parties that share a key.
 *   - **HKDF turns key material into keys.** What comes out of a key exchange, or a master
 *     secret, is not yet a key for anything: HKDF extracts a uniform key from it and expands
 *     that into as many separate keys as a protocol needs, each bound to a label so that a key
 *     for one purpose is useless for another.
 *
 * Neither is for passwords. A password has little entropy, and both of these are fast - an
 * attacker tries billions a second. Stretching a password needs a function made slow on
 * purpose (PBKDF2, scrypt, Argon2), which this library does not have.
 *
 * Pure computation: no allocation, no OS; part of the freestanding profile.
