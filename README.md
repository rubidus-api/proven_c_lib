# Proven C library

`proven` is a small C23 systems library for code that should stay readable over time. It gives you the everyday pieces C projects usually end up rewriting: explicit allocators, owned and borrowed strings, dynamic arrays, maps with borrowed or owned string keys, formatting and scanning, filesystem helpers, memory mapping, time, stackless coroutines, and a bounded job system.

The point is not to hide C behind a framework. The point is to make practical C less repetitive while still keeping ownership, errors, allocator choice, and platform boundaries visible.

The build driver probes `-std=c23` first and falls back to `-std=c2x` when the compiler still uses the transitional spelling, so older GCC and Clang front ends can still build the tree without changing the library's C23 baseline.

## why people reach for it

- Ownership is explicit, so it is easier to see who allocates and who frees.
- Fallible APIs return results instead of silently hiding failure.
- Reallocation-style operations are designed to stay failure-atomic where documented.
- Borrowed views are clearly separated from owning objects.
- Hosted OS access is isolated behind the PAL layer in `platform/`.
- Freestanding builds can use the reduced core without pulling in hosted filesystem, console, thread, mmap, or environment services.
- The build system is a single C file, `nob.c`, so there is no mandatory CMake, Meson, npm, or external test framework.

That makes the library useful for command-line tools, embedded-adjacent code, experiment code that may later need a stricter platform boundary, and C projects that want a compact support layer without giving up control.

## quick start

Build the driver and run the default hosted test/build path:

```sh
cc nob.c -o nob
./nob build
```

Use a different compiler if needed:

```sh
./nob strict-error -cc clang
```

Common checks:

```sh
./nob release
./nob asan
./nob ubsan
./nob tsan
./nob regression
./nob freestanding
./nob cross -build-root /home/user/work/build/proven_c_lib
```

Running `./nob` without arguments prints the full command list.

## a small example

This example creates an owned UTF-8 string, appends to it with the formatter, prints it, and then destroys it with the same allocator family.

```c
#include "proven.h"

int main(void) {
    proven_allocator_t alloc = proven_heap_allocator();

    proven_result_u8str_t r =
        proven_u8str_create_from_view(alloc, PROVEN_LIT("hello"));
    if (!proven_is_ok(r.err)) {
        return 1;
    }

    proven_u8str_t s = r.value;

    proven_fmt_result_t fr =
        proven_u8str_append_fmt_grow(alloc, &s, ", {}", PROVEN_ARG("world"));
    if (!proven_is_ok(fr.err)) {
        proven_u8str_destroy(alloc, &s);
        return 1;
    }

    proven_println("{}", PROVEN_ARG(proven_u8str_as_view(&s)));
    proven_u8str_destroy(alloc, &s);
    return 0;
}
```

Build it against the hosted sources:

```sh
cc -std=c23 -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L \
  -Iinclude -Iplatform \
  app.c src/proven/*.c platform/proven_sys_*.c \
  -pthread -o app
```

## containers without hidden ownership

`proven_array_t` is a growable contiguous array. It stores the allocator trait used for growth and destruction, so the call site stays honest about memory ownership.

```c
#include "proven.h"

int main(void) {
    proven_allocator_t alloc = proven_heap_allocator();

    proven_result_array_t r = PROVEN_ARRAY_INIT(alloc, int, 4);
    if (!proven_is_ok(r.err)) {
        return 1;
    }

    proven_array_t numbers = r.value;

    if (!proven_is_ok(PROVEN_ARRAY_PUSH(&numbers, int, 10))) goto fail;
    if (!proven_is_ok(PROVEN_ARRAY_PUSH(&numbers, int, 20))) goto fail;

    const int *first = PROVEN_ARRAY_GET(&numbers, int, 0);
    if (!first) goto fail;

    proven_println("first = {}", PROVEN_ARG(*first));
    PROVEN_ARRAY_DESTROY(&numbers);
    return 0;

fail:
    PROVEN_ARRAY_DESTROY(&numbers);
    return 1;
}
```

The same pattern appears across strings, maps, buffers, arenas, pools, and filesystem helpers: create with an allocator, check the result, keep borrowed pointers short-lived, and destroy owned objects deliberately.

## text formatting with bounded input

`PROVEN_ARG("literal")` is convenient for trusted NUL-terminated strings. For text from outside your program, prefer bounded views or bounded C-string arguments so formatting does not search past the bytes you meant to expose.

```c
const char packet_text[5] = { 'o', 'k', '!', '!', 'x' };
proven_println("rx: {}", PROVEN_ARG_CSTR_N(packet_text, 4));
```

The formatter has three useful modes for owned strings:

- `proven_u8str_append_fmt`: fixed-capacity and atomic.
- `proven_u8str_append_fmt_trunc`: fixed-capacity and truncating.
- `proven_u8str_append_fmt_grow`: allocator-backed and atomic.

## platform boundary

Portable implementation files live in `src/proven/`. OS and C runtime calls are isolated under `platform/`:

- heap allocation
- filesystem operations
- time
- environment access
- console I/O
- threads
- memory mapping
- math helpers where needed

This split keeps the core library easier to audit and gives ports a clear place to work. Hosted Linux is the primary runtime target today. The build also has compile-only checks for optional targets when the toolchains are installed: Linux AArch64, Linux ARM hard-float, Linux i686, MinGW Windows x86_64/i686, ARM Cortex-M freestanding, and RISC-V ELF freestanding.

Cross compilation shows that headers, source visibility, ABI assumptions, and compile-time platform branches line up. It does not replace runtime tests on the target machine.

## main modules

- Foundation: `types`, `error`, `memory`, `align`.
- Allocation: `allocator`, `heap`, `arena`, `pool`.
- Buffers and strings: `buffer`, `u8str`, `u16str`.
- Containers: `array`, `list`, `ring`, `map`.
- Algorithms: `algorithm`.
- Text: `fmt`, `scan`.
- Hosted services: `fs`, `time`, `mmap`, `sysio`.
- Execution: `coro`, `job`.
- Diagnostics: `panic`.
- Optional short aliases: `alias_xcv`.

## what it is not

`proven` is not a libc replacement, a garbage collector, or a framework. It does not try to own your process, your build graph, or your error policy. It is a set of C components that are meant to be easy to read, easy to test, and possible to port one boundary at a time.

## status

The primary verified target is Linux x86_64 with GCC or Clang in C23 mode. Sanitizer, regression, freestanding, and cross compile checks are driven by `nob.c`. Optional cross targets are checked when the corresponding toolchains are present. The build driver probes `-std=c23` first and falls back to `-std=c2x` when needed.

Cross compilation is compile-time coverage only. It checks that the headers, PAL splits, and target-specific branches compile together; it does not replace runtime validation on each target.

Borrowed views require caller-managed lifetime. Public structs expose layout for C use, but callers should not manually corrupt them; validation helpers exist for defensive checks.

Strict pointer provenance is not fully claimed here. The library is designed to avoid common C undefined-behavior hazards under documented contracts on conventional hosted-systems C implementations.
