/**
 * @file deflate.h
 * @brief DEFLATE compression and decompression (RFC 1951), bare or framed as zlib (RFC 1950)
 *        or gzip (RFC 1952).
 *
 * DEFLATE is the compression inside gzip files, HTTP's `Content-Encoding: gzip`, PNG, ZIP
 * and WebSocket's `permessage-deflate`. It replaces repeated stretches of bytes by "the same
 * as 300 bytes ago, for 40 bytes" and then writes what is left with shorter codes for what is
 * common. Text shrinks to a third or a quarter; data that is already compressed or encrypted
 * does not shrink at all.
 *
 * Both directions work the same way: a state object, and a step that takes what input there
 * is and fills what output space there is.
 *
 *   - A step never allocates and never writes past the output it was given.
 *   - `PROVEN_OK` with nothing consumed and nothing produced means it needs more of one or
 *     the other.
 *   - `*done` becomes true when the stream has ended - when decompressing, where the stream
 *     said so; when compressing, after everything asked for by `PROVEN_DEFLATE_FINISH` is out.
 *
 * **Decompression is where the care goes.** The input may come from anyone. A kilobyte of
 * DEFLATE can expand to a megabyte, so the caller always decides how much output it will
 * take: the step function by the buffer it passes, the whole-buffer helper by a required
 * limit. Malformed input is an error, never a read or a write outside the buffers.
 *
 * Pure computation: one allocation when a state is made, no OS; part of the freestanding
 * profile.
