/**
 * @file tls.h
 * @brief TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) and a cut-down TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246), client and server.
 *
 * TLS turns a connection anyone on the path can read and change into one that only the two
 * ends can: the peer is who its certificate says, and what is sent arrives unread and
 * unaltered or not at all.
 *
 * There are two layers here, and most programs want the second:
 *
 *   - **The engine** (`proven_tls_conn_t`) is a state machine with no I/O in it. You hand it
 *     the bytes that arrived, it hands you the bytes to send, and between the two it keeps the
 *     keys. It calls no operating system, so it can be tested without a network, driven from
 *     an event loop, and used in a freestanding build that has its own transport.
 *   - **The transport wrapper** (`proven_tls_transport_client`, `proven_tls_transport_server`)
 *     runs the engine over a `proven_transport_t` and is itself a `proven_transport_t`:
 *     anything that reads and writes a transport - the HTTP client and server, a WebSocket
 *     connection - then speaks TLS without knowing it. Hosted only.
 *
 * Both take a `proven_tls_config_t`: whom to believe, who you are, and a few choices. A config
 * is built once, never changes, and is shared by as many connections and threads as you like.
 *
 * **What this is not.** A new implementation with no external audit (the manual says what it
 * was tested against). Of TLS 1.2 only the ECDHE and AEAD suites, with the extended master
 * secret required and renegotiation declined; nothing older. No 0-RTT. No revocation checking. A
 * program whose users depend on it against a capable adversary should terminate TLS in
 * something audited.
